# Text Stroke in SwiftUI
Text Stroke is a view modifier that adds a stroke to text in SwiftUI.

*Caution: Only works with a stroke width less than the thickness of the font.*

**All feedback welcome.**

## Why?
SwiftUI does not have a built-in method of adding an outline to text commonly found in graphic design tools like Figma. After attempting many approaches, I've found this technique produces the most accurate results.
